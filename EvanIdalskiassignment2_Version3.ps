Why?\nIn my opinion I think any size project could benefit from using version management software. One example is the assignment that we are working on in our programming class. By using the different versions of the assignment files to save your program at different levels so you can have both of them open to go back and forth on. Another example is branching because you can change a program to look like the original or to make changes to test new features with out modifying the original branch that we created. The next example is merging, merging allows branches from one to another by taking information on the branches and then combine them together to form new branches of code. My last example is conflicts. Conflicts is when someone is making their change first and it prevents another person from making their change. The only way to fix this problem is to check out the latest version to fix the conflict problem. ")
